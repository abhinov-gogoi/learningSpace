Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables,
but the methods declared in an interface are by default abstract (only method signature, no body).

It is used to provide total abstraction.
That means all the methods in an interface
are declared with an empty body and are public
and all fields are public, static and final by default.
A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.

To implement interface use implements keyword.

    // by default.}
